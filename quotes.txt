Only half? My life is either boring as FUCK or I’ll die at 38, don’t know what’s more depressing.I guess I’ll read on to the point I get married, if it happens.
But wouldn't I just be reading about me reading the book until I put down the book?
I put it downafter about twenty pages, boring read.
I’d read it every new year to see how fast I’m progressing through my story.
I’d also have someone read the end and tell me if I should be doing something different to make sure it has a happy ending.
